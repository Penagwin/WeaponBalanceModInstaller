#[SlothSquadron - Weapon Balance Mod](https://csgoweaponbalancemod.wordpress.com/)
###[Quick Install - Windows](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Penagwin/WeaponBalanceModInstaller/master/windows/wbm-Installer.bat)
----

>  The CS:GO Weapon Balance Mod was created as a way to test long requested weapon changes and provide possible solutions to existing problems identified by Valve and the community.  Such examples being reworked accuracy mechanics for rifles to encourage tapping and bursting for a more varied playstyle (something Valve previously attempted to do), pistol revamps to put less emphasis on randomness to make pistol and eco rounds more skill based, and reworked AWPing mechanics to allow for a more aggressive playstyle to combat the precise rifles found in this mod.
